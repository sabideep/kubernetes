Labels
selectors
Annotations



labels: labels are key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects. We can attach labels @metadata.lables
   labels:
     app: myappName
     environment: dev

Selectors: It is used to identifying and selecting specific groups of objects based on labels.

Annotations: They are similar to labels(key val) and they can  be used to store custom data about object. They cannot be used with Selectors.


Deployment: It provides a way to declaratively managed the dynamics set of replica pods.
           It defines the desired state for replica pods and cluster will constantly maintain the desired state by creating, removing and modifing the pods.


POD: it is a building blocks of any applications in Kubernetes.
     A pod consists of  one or more containers  and set of resources shared by containers.
     objecttype: Pod
     crete yaml definition for objects

Services: It creates abstraction layer for the network access to the dynamic sets of PODS. The services uses SELCTOR to determine which pods will receive traffic thru the service.
        First create deployment with selector.
        Create service with the same selctor.
        clusterIP: The cluster is exposed  within the cluster using an internal IP address.
        NodePort:  the serivice is exposed  externally via  a port  which listens on each node  in the cluster.
        LoadBalancer: This works if your cluster is set up to work with a cloud provider. The service is exposed thru loadbalancer  that is created on the cloud platform.
        ExternalName: This map the service to external address.
